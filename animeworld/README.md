From what I gathered, the site requires an injection of a cookie or something similiar in order to pass the security check (?). Either way I could not get it to work as it always got stuck on this:
```log

----
[03-02 22:08:41] [HTMLStrings] <html><body><script>document.cookie="SecurityAW-E4=a57203ce8a76314514a3df17efae80f3 ;  path=/";location.href="http://www.animeworld.so/search?keyword=r&d=2";</script></body></html>
----
[03-02 22:08:41] [Error] Failed to parse results
```
I am leaving this, as well as the whole module, for later, because I either am too stupid or this just will not work
